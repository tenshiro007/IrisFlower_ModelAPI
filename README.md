# IrisFlower_ModelAPI
Machine Learning Iris Flower model training to API
Build a Machine Learning API with Python and Flask.


# The Model
a machine learning model trained on the famous iris dataset. 
for dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
When making predictions, we will have four input parameters: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and finally, petal width. 
Those will help to decide which type of iris flower the input is.
